Writing First C++ Program – Hello World Example


// C++ program to display "Hello World"
 
// Header file for input output functions
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
// Main() function: where the execution of
// program begins
int main()
{
    // Prints hello world
    cout << "Hello World";
 
    return 0;
}
********************************************************************************************************
C++ is a widely used Object Oriented Programming language and is relatively easy to understand. 
The “Hello World” program is the first step towards learning any programming language and is also one of
the most straightforward programs you will learn.

The Hello World Program in C++ is the basic program that is used to demonstrate how the coding process works.
All you have to do is display the message “Hello World” on the console screen.

 #include
This is a preprocessor directive. The #include directive tells the compiler to include the content of a file in the source code.

For example, #include<iostream> tells the compiler to include the standard iostream 
file which contains declarations of all the standard input/output library functions. Click to Know More on Preprocessors.

3. using namespace std
This is used to import the entity of the std namespace into the current namespace of the program.
The statement using namespace std is generally considered a bad practice.
 When we import a namespace we are essentially pulling all type definitions into the current scope.

The std namespace is huge. The alternative to this statement is to specify the namespace to which
the identifier belongs using the scope operator(::) each time we declare a type. For example, std::cout. 
Click to know More about using namespace std.

4. int main() { }
A function is a group of statements that are designed to perform a specific task.
The main() function is the entry point of every C++ program, no matter where the function is located in the program.

The opening braces ‘{‘ indicates the beginning of the main function and the closing braces ‘}’ indicates
the ending of the main function. Click to know More about the main() function.

5. cout<<“Hello World”;
std::cout is an instance of the std::ostream class, that is used to display output on the screen. Everything followed by
the character << in double quotes ” ” is displayed on the output device. The semi-colon character at the end of
the statement is used to indicate that the statement is ending there. Click to know More on Input/Output.

7. return 0
This statement is used to return a value from a function and indicates the finishing of a function.
 This statement is basically used in functions to return the results of the operations performed by a function.

9. Indentation
As you can see the cout and the return statement have been indented or moved to the right side.
 This is done to make the code more readable. We must always use indentations and comments to make the code more readable.
Must read the FAQ on the style of writing programs.

Important Points
Always include the necessary header files for the smooth execution of functions. 
For example, <iostream> must be included to use std::cin and std::cout.
The execution of code begins from the main() function.
It is a good practice to use Indentation and comments in programs for easy understanding.
cout is used to print statements and cin is used to take inputs.

C++ comes with libraries that provide us with many ways for performing input and output. In C++ input and output are performed in the form of a sequence of bytes or more commonly known as streams.

Input Stream: If the direction of flow of bytes is from the device(for example, Keyboard) to the main memory then this process is called input.
Output Stream: If the direction of flow of bytes is opposite, i.e. from main memory to device( display screen ) then this process is called output.
Basic Input / Output in C++

Header files available in C++ for Input/Output operations are: 

iostream: iostream stands for standard input-output stream. This header file contains definitions of objects like cin, cout, cerr, etc.
iomanip: iomanip stands for input-output manipulators. The methods declared in these files are used for manipulating streams. This file contains definitions of setw, setprecision, etc.
fstream: This header file mainly describes the file stream. This header file is used to handle the data being read from a file as input or data being written into the file as output.
bits/stdc++: This header file includes every standard library. In programming contests, using this file is a good idea, when you want to reduce the time wasted in doing chores;
especially when your rank is time sensitive. To know more about this header file refer this article.
In C++ after the header files, we often use ‘using namespace std;‘. The reason behind it is that all of the standard library definitions are inside the namespace std.
As the library functions are not defined at global scope, so in order to use them we use namespace std. So, that we don’t need to write STD:: at every line (eg. STD::cout etc.). To know more refer this article.

The two instances cout in C++ and cin in C++ of iostream class are used very often for printing outputs and taking inputs respectively. 
These two are the most basic methods of taking input and printing output in C++. To use cin and cout in C++ one must include the header file iostream in the program.

This article mainly discusses the objects defined in the header file iostream like the cin and cout.  

Standard output stream (cout): Usually the standard output device is the display screen. The C++ cout statement is the instance of the ostream class. 
It is used to produce output on the standard output device which is usually the display screen. The data needed to be displayed on the screen is inserted in 
the standard output stream (cout) using the insertion operator(<<).
